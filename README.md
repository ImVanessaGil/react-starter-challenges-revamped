# react-starter-challenges-revamped

1. Cerate a new React application with vite.
2. Install the following dependencies:
`mui/material, react-router-dom`
3. Create and implement a `BrowserRouter`.
4. Add browser routes for the following projects:
`tic-tac-toe`, `video` and `github-clone` 
5. Add a shared `NavLayout` so users can navigate to the 3 previous routes.
6. Go to the [React Docs](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#wrapping-up) and clone the  `tic-tac-toe` example without following the tutorial. Also, make it pretty. Use MUI and try to make it both, enjoyable to use and enjoyable to look at.
7. Go to [React Docs](https://reac.dev/) and scroll to the bottom of the page and clone the `Video Searcher` component to search vides using the `https://search.imdbot.workers.dev/?q=` endpoint. You must re create the component using [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/), [react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) and [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro).

*Expected result:*
